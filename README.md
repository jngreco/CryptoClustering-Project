# Unsupervised Machine Learning
In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Prepare the Data
* Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

* Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

  * The first five rows of the scaled DataFrame should appear as follows:
